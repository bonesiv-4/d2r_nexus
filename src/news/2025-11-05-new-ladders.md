We're excited to announce the launch of two brand-new ladders, both designed to test your skills in exciting and unconventional ways. If you're looking for a fresh challenge beyond the standard meta, your time has come.

### Ladder 1: Level 59 MLD (Mid-Level Duels)

We're kicking off a **Level 59 Mid-Level Duels (MLD)** ladder! This is where true theorycrafting shines. Forget your HLD toons for a moment; this ladder is all about optimizing gear, breakpoints, and skill choices within a tight level constraint. It’s a nostalgic and highly competitive bracket that rewards cunning and preparation. Do you have what it takes to dominate the mid-level arena?

### Ladder 2: Stabby Stabs (Melee Necromancer - Poison Dagger)

That's right. Our second ladder is a true test of skill, stripping the Necromancer down to its core: **Melee Necromancer - Poison Dagger**.

This is a highly restrictive, NvN (Necromancer vs. Necromancer) format where **only Poison Dagger** may be used to deal damage. With core items like *Bramble*, *Plague*, *Blackbog’s* and *Cure* expressly **banned**, victory will depend on pure player ability. Competitors must master the art of the toxicant in either "No-Tele" (Inner Cloister) or "Tele" (Blood Moor) formats.

Full ladder details are available now. Check the 🗡️nvn-daggers-rules channel for specifics.

Gear up your new toons, and let's see who rises to the top.

See you in the Blood Moor!
